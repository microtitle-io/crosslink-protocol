## License

Crosslink Protocol is open source code, under the MIT License. Please see LICENSE file for more info.

## Purpose

The Crosslink Protocol is a permissionless system for creating NFT "microtitles"
for physical goods and property. The titles confer proof of authenticity, ownership,
and facilitate the verification of real-world objects on a public blockchain. 
The protocol is intended to help remove intermediaries and reduce transactional friction, reduce
theft and loss for its users, and overall promote the use of blockchains such as Solana for
public good. 

## Documentation

Please see the **docs** folder in this repository for technical description of the protocol.
